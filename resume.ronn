## DESCRIPTION

Major is a Linux Engineer with skills in database administration, system
administration, application development and leadership. He enjoys connecting
people with technology solutions that are easy to use, affordable, and
sustainable over time. He is familiar with, and a huge supporter of, the DevOps
culture and how to make it work with a large team in a fast paced environment.

Information security has also been a key interest for him. As the Chief Security
Architect for Rackspace, he led a team of senior Windows, Linux and networking
engineers who were dedicated to increasing security within Rackspace and for
their customers. He provided critical security advisement to the business as a
whole and he fueled technical security projects that reduced risk, reduced
product development cycle time, and increased customer confidence.

He previously worked on the OpenStack project and its integration with Citrix
Xenserver and Nicira's networking stack. He also maintained high-availability
clusters, Debian packaging and various system tools and scripts. The team
created a highly automated continuous integration system with Jenkins that
allowed them to test and deploy new code much more rapidly than before.
